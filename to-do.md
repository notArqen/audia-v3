## goals for the long game

- **add lyrics function** - sleek, polished, timed lyrics like Apple Music holds in fullscreen mode; toggleable from an svg button near the controls.
- **add speed and pitch sliders** - sliders in the bottom, Now Playing pane that independently change speed and pitch. speed uses an algorithm to avoid naturally changing the pitch when the speed is changed. pitch will act as normal.
- **add a mixing feature** - comes with an automix when a playlist is mixed but is customizable between songs; resembles Spotify's mixing features
