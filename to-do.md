- **fix lossless badge** - lossless will be shown regardless of if the track playing is truly lossless
- **fix bottom of album covers** - the center pane's album cover will have square bottoms and round tops. also, when flipping, rounded sides disappear
- **fix crossplay funkyness** - sometimes the track will be skipped, cut, not overlap, and more.
- **fix random stopping** - the tracks tend to randomly mute and a page refresh is required...losing the queue
- **add native volume slider** - add a volume slider for the just now playing content
- **algorithm updates** - ensure alg is not just based on current song when initialized...also based on all the other songs in the queue

## goals for the long game

- **add lyrics function** - sleek, polished, timed lyrics like Apple Music holds in fullscreen mode; toggleable from an svg button near the controls.
- **add speed and pitch sliders** - sliders in the bottom, Now Playing pane that independently change speed and pitch. speed uses an algorithm to avoid naturally changing the pitch when the speed is changed. pitch will act as normal.
- **add a mixing feature** - comes with an automix when a playlist is mixed but is customizable between songs; resembles Spotify's mixing features
